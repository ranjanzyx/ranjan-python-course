## Introduction to Version Control
- **Version control**, also known as **source control**, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
- It's a crucial tool in the development process, especially when multiple people are working on the same codebase.

### Why is Version Control Important?
- **Track Changes:** 
  - It keeps a record of every modification to the code. 
  - If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake.
- **Collaboration:** 
  - Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously. 
  - Version control systems manage modifications from multiple sources, ensuring there are no conflicts between changes.
- **Backup:** 
  - It serves as a backup, you can always recover earlier versions if something goes wrong.
- **Understanding:** 
  - It helps in understanding what happened over time. 
  - The history of the changes is a great resource to find out why and how the code evolved.

### Types of Version Control Systems (VCS)
- **Local Version Control Systems:** 
  - Simplest form. Each developer has their own local database that keeps all the changes to files.
  - **Pros:** 
    - Simple and easy.
  - **Cons:** 
    - Risky because it's local. 
    - If you lose your device or data, everything's gone.
- **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS):** 
  - Systems like SVN and CVS have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.
  - **Pros:** 
    - Everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else is doing. 
    - Administratively, it's much easier to control.
  - **Cons:** 
    - The central server is a single point of failure. 
    - If the server goes down, no one can collaborate or save versioned changes.
- **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS):** 
  - Systems like Git and Mercurial. 
  - Clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; they fully mirror the repository, including its full history.
  - **Pros:** 
    - If any server dies, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. 
    - Every checkout is a full backup.
  - **Cons:** 
    - More complex, can be harder to understand and manage.

### How Git Fits In
- Git is a Distributed Version Control System. Here's how it differs and stands out:
1. **Speed:** 
   - Git is designed to be fast. 
   - The performance of Git is a significant advantage over some other version control systems.
2. **Distributed:** 
   - Every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.
3. **Data Integrity:** 
   - Git ensures the integrity of data. 
   - It uses a mechanism called checksum (SHA-1 hash) to name and identify objects within its database.
4. **Non-linear Development**: 
   - Git supports rapid branching and merging and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history.

### Install Git
Git can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems with ease.
  - **Windows:**
    - Download the official Git for Windows installer from the Git website.
    - Run the installer and follow the steps in the installation wizard. 
    - The default options are usually suitable for most users.
  - **Mac:**
    - The easiest way to install Git on a Mac is via the stand-alone installer:
    - Download the latest Git for Mac installer.
    - You can also install Git via Homebrew (a package manager for macOS):
  - **Linux (Ubuntu):**
    ```sql
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    ```
    

### Basic Commands
- **git init:** 
  - Initializes a new Git repository. 
  - This creates a new subdirectory named .git that houses all of your repository's data and metadata.
  - `git init`
- **git add:**
- - Adds files from your working directory to the staging area, making them ready for a commit.
  - `git add <filename> # Adds a specific file`
  - `git add . # Adds all files in the directory`
- **git commit:**
  - Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. 
  - Combined with a message, it's a record of what was changed and why.
  - `git commit -m "Commit message"`
- **git status:**
  - Displays the status of your working directory and staging area. 
  - It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files are not being tracked by Git.
  - `git status`
- **git log:**
  - Shows the chronological commit history for the current branch.
  - `git log`

```bash
# Initializes a new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.
git init

# Adds files from your working directory to your staging area.
git add <filename>

# Captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
git commit -m "descriptive message"

# Shows the commit history for the currently active branch.
git log

# Shows the file differences which are not yet staged.
git diff

# Shows the list of tracked and untracked files.
git status

# Creates a new branch.
git branch <branchname>

# Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory.
git checkout <branchname>

# Combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch.
git merge <branchname>

# Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub.
git pull

# Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub.
git push
```
### Understanding Repositories
- A Git repository is like a data structure used by Git to store all the information (metadata, changes, commit history, etc.) of a project.
- It's essentially a directory on your machine after you've told Git to monitor it (usually via `git init`).
- The `.git` directory inside a repository holds all the configuration and information about the repository's history and structure.
#### Initializing a New Repository:
1. Navigate to your project's directory: `cd /path/to/your/project`
2. Initialize the directory as a Git repository: `git init`
    - This command creates a hidden .git directory in your project. 
    - This .git directory is what Git uses to track the repository's history and settings.
### Working with Repositories
- **Cloning**
  - Cloning is the process of making a local copy of a remote repository. 
  - This is often used to collaborate on projects hosted on services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- **How to Clone a Repository:**
  - Find the URL of the remote repository you want to clone. 
  - This can usually be found on the repository page on your version control hosting service.
  - Open a terminal or command prompt.
  - Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL: `git clone [url-of-the-repository]`
  - This will create a directory named after the repository and initialize a `.git` directory inside it, pulling down all the data for that repository.
- **Staging Area**
  - The staging area is a concept that is unique to Git. 
  - It's a layer that separates the working directory (your current working files) from the commit history.
  - The staging area is what you prepare to go into your next commit, which means you can make it look exactly how you want before you commit your changes.
### Working with the Staging Area:
- **Stage Files:**
  - Use `git add` to stage files that you've changed.
    - Stage a single file: `git add <filename>` 
    - Stage all changes: `git add .` 
- **Unstage Files:**
  - If you decide you want to unstage a file that you've added to the staging area, you can use git reset.
  - Unstage a single file: `git reset <filename>`

### Working with Commits
- Commits are the heart of Git's power. A commit is a snapshot of your entire repository at one point in time.
- **Making Commits:**
  - After staging your changes with git add, you're ready to commit.
  - `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`
- **Viewing Commits:**
  - `git log` shows the commit history.
  - Just `git log` will show the history with the most recent commits at the top, listing the commit ID, author, date, and message.
  - For a more condensed view, `git log --oneline` can be used.
- **Understanding Commit History:**
  - Git's commit history is what makes it a powerful tool for tracking changes and understanding how a project has evolved. 
  - Each commit has a unique ID (SHA hash) that allows you to reference that point in history.
  - The history can be navigated using various commands (git log, git diff, git checkout, etc.).

# Branching and Merging in Git
Branching and merging are fundamental concepts in Git, allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other.

## Branches
Branches represent an independent line of development in a project, allowing you to move back and forth between 'states' of your project. 
They are used to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas.

| Operation         | Command                          | Description                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Creating Branches | `git branch <branch-name>`       | Creates a new branch with the specified name.                                                                                        |
| Listing Branches  | `git branch`                     | Lists all the branches in the repository.                                                                                            |
| Deleting Branches | `git branch -d <branch-name>`    | Deletes the specified branch. This is a safe operation because Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes. |

### Switching Branches
To work on a branch, you need to switch to it. 
Switching updates the files in your working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.

| Operation           | Command                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Switching Branches  | `git checkout <branch-name>` | Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory. Git will not allow you to switch branches if you have unsaved changes that conflict with the target branch. |

## Merging
- Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. 
- It’s a critical part of the collaborative software development process and is used to combine completed features, resolve conflicts, and ensure code stability.

### How to Merge Branches
1. **Switch to the Receiving Branch:**
    - Make sure you're on the branch that should receive the changes.
    - Command: `git checkout <target-branch>`

2. **Merge the Target Branch:**
    - Use the `git merge` command to integrate the target branch (e.g., a feature branch) into the current branch (e.g., main).
    - Command: `git merge <source-branch>`
    - This command combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch. If there are no conflicts, it will create a new "merge commit" in the target branch to tie the histories together.
- Branching and merging are fundamental concepts in Git, allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other.
### Understanding Merge Conflicts:
- Sometimes, Git can’t automatically resolve differences in code between two commits and will ask you to manually resolve conflicts.
- Conflicts usually occur when two branches have made edits to the same line in a file or when one branch deleted a file while the other modified it.
- Git will mark the file as conflicted and halt the merging process. 
- You need to resolve the conflicts manually by editing the files, and then commit the resolved changes.
---
## Remote Repositories
- Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or network somewhere.
- They can greatly facilitate collaboration between team members by providing a central place where all the code and its history are stored.

### Understanding Remote Repositories
- **Enable Collaboration:** 
  - Multiple people can work on the same project from different locations. 
  - Team members can push updates and pull changes from the remote repository.
- **Backup:** 
  - Having a remote repository means you have a backup of your project and its entire change history.
- **Central Point of Truth:** 
  - The remote repository often serves as the central point of truth for a project. 
  - Everyone's local repositories are derived from it.
### Difference Between Local and Remote Repositories
- **Local Repository:** This is the version of your project that resides on your local machine. It's where you'll do all your work: make changes, add features, fix bugs, and so on. The local repository has its own history of commits.
- **Remote Repository:** This is the version of your project that resides on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). You can push your local changes to the remote repository to share them with others, and you can pull changes from the remote repository to get updated work from your team members.
#### Working with Remote Repositories
1. **Adding a Remote Repository:**
- When you clone a repository, Git automatically adds that remote repository under the name "origin".
- If you started locally and later decide to add a remote repository, use the `git remote add` command:
- `git remote add <shortname> <url>`
  - `<shortname>` is the name you give to the remote repository (e.g., origin).
  - `<url>` is the URL of the remote repository (e.g., the URL of the GitHub repository).
2. **Fetching Changes from a Remote Repository:**
- `git fetch <remote>` 
  - This command downloads all the changes from the remote repository, but it doesn't merge those changes into your local branches. 
  - It allows you to review changes before merging them into your local repo.
  - `git fetch origin`
3. **Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository:**
- `git pull <remote> <branch>`
  - This command fetches the specified branch from the remote repository and immediately merges it into the local copy of that branch.
  - `git pull origin main`
4. **Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository:**
- After committing your changes locally, you'll want to share them with your team by pushing the changes to the remote repository.
- `git push <remote> <branch>`: 
  - This command sends your committed changes to the specified remote repository and branch.
  - `git push origin main`
  - This will push your main branch to the origin remote (commonly the default remote repository).

##  Branching Strategies
- Branching strategies are frameworks that dictate how branches are created and used in development processes. 
- They play a crucial role in managing features, fixes, and releases. 
- Here are some of the most widely used branching strategies:

### Feature Branch Workflow
- **Concept:** 
  - Every new feature is developed in its own branch instead of the main branch. 
  - This ensures the main branch never contains broken code.
- **Usage:**
  - When a developer starts work on a feature, they create a new branch specific to that feature.
  - After the feature is completed and tested, the branch is merged back into the main branch.
- Ideal for teams that need to maintain a stable main branch.

### Gitflow Workflow
- **Concept:** 
  - This is an extension of the feature branch workflow and prescribes specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact.
  - **Branches Involved:**
    1. **Main:** Stores the official release history.
    2. **Develop:** Serves as an integration branch for features.
    3. **Feature:** Used to develop new features.
    4. **Release:** Supports preparation of a new production release.
    5. **Hotfix:** Used to quickly patch production releases.
- **Usage:**
  - New development (features and non-emergency bug fixes) are built in feature branches.
  - Feature branches are merged into the develop branch.
  - When it's time to make a release, a release branch is created off of develop.
  - After the release is done, the release branch is merged into main and develop.
  - Hotfix branches are created from main and, once the fix is complete, merged into both main and develop.
- Ideal for projects that have a scheduled release cycle and for maintaining a clean production branch.

### Forking Workflow
- **Concept:** 
  - Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, each developer gets their own server-side repository.
- **Usage:**
  - This approach is very powerful for open-source projects because it allows anybody to contribute without needing access to push to the official codebase.
  - The project maintainer can accept commits from any developer by pulling the changes from their repository into the main codebase.

### Choosing a Branching Strategy
- **Project Size and Complexity:** Smaller projects with fewer contributors might not need the robust structure of Gitflow and might opt for something simpler like the Feature Branch Workflow.
- **Release Cycle:** If you have scheduled releases, consider Gitflow. If your project has continuous delivery, you might opt for the Feature Branch or Forking Workflow.
- **Team Preferences and Expertise:** The branching strategy should also align with the team's familiarity and comfort with Git. A complex strategy like Gitflow might be overkill for a team new to Git.

# Resolving Conflicts
- Merge conflicts in Git occur when two branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when one branch deleted a file while the other branch was modifying it. 
- Git is unable to automatically determine which change to accept, so the user must resolve these conflicts manually. Here's how to handle and resolve merge conflicts effectively:

## Understanding Merge Conflicts
- Conflicts typically arise during a `git merge` or a `git rebase` operation.
- Git will mark the file as conflicted and will halt the merging process, allowing you to resolve the conflict and proceed with the merge.
### Identifying Conflicts
- When a conflict occurs, Git will output a message indicating which files are in conflict.
- Running `git status` will show the files that need resolution.
### Resolving Conflicts
1. **Edit the Conflicted Files:**
- Open the conflicted files in your text editor.
- Git marks the conflicted areas in the file with special symbols:
- `<<<<<<< HEAD`: Indicates the start of the conflicting changes from the current branch.
- `=======`: Separates your changes from the changes in the other branch.
- `>>>>>>> [other-branch-name]`: Indicates the end of the conflicting changes from the other branch.

- Decide what the final code should look like and manually edit the file to resolve the conflict.
2. **Mark the Conflict as Resolved:**
- After you've resolved the conflict in a file, you need to mark it as resolved. 
- This is done by staging the file for commit:
- `git add <filename>`
- This tells Git that the conflict has been resolved.
3. **Commit the Resolution:**
- Once all conflicts have been resolved and the changes have been staged, you need to commit those changes.
- `git commit`
- Git will open an editor window for you to enter a commit message. 
- By default, it includes a message about the merge and the conflicts that were resolved. You can edit this message if you like or keep it as is.
### Tools and Strategies for Resolving Conflicts
1. **Use a Merge Tool:**
- Git offers a built-in tool for resolving conflicts visually.
- You can invoke it by running `git mergetool`. 
- This opens a GUI that helps you navigate and resolve conflicts.
2. **Understand the Context:**
- Understanding the context of the changes and why they were made can be crucial in resolving conflicts. 
- Communicate with your team members to understand their changes before deciding on how to merge.
3. **Frequent Merges:**
- Merge changes from the main branch into feature branches frequently. 
- The more up-to-date your branch is, the less likely you are to encounter complex merge conflicts.
4. **Clear Commit Messages:**
- Writing clear commit messages can be invaluable in understanding the intent behind changes, which in turn can make conflict resolution easier.
---
# Rewriting History
- Rewriting history in Git can be powerful but dangerous if not done carefully. 
- It involves altering the commits, their messages, or even their content after they've been made. 
- This can clean up a project's history, combine multiple commits into one, or alter commit messages for clarity.

## Implications of Rewriting History
- **Local vs. Remote Repositories:** 
  - It's relatively safe to rewrite history in a local repository if you haven't pushed your changes to a remote repository. 
  - However, rewriting history on a branch that has been pushed to a remote repository and shared with others can cause significant problems.
- **Collaboration Issues:** 
  - If someone else has based their work on the commits you're rewriting, they'll run into conflicts when pulling the changes. 
  - It can lead to a lot of confusion and extra work to sort out what happened.
- **Amending Commits**
  - If you just made a commit and realized you forgot to include some changes or you want to edit the commit message, you can amend the commit.
  - `git commit --amend`
  - This opens your text editor and allows you to change the commit message. 
  - It also stages any changes you've made since the last commit, so you can include them in the amended commit.
## Rebasing
- Rebasing is a way to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 
- It's a cleaner alternative to merging, as it creates a linear project history.
- ### Basic Rebase:
  - If you want to rebase your current branch onto, for example, the main branch, you would:
  - ```bash
    git checkout feature-branch
    git rebase main
    ```
  - This moves all the commits in feature-branch to begin on the tip of main, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in main.
- ### Interactive Rebasing
  - Interactive rebasing gives you the opportunity to alter commits as they are moved to the new base.
  - `git rebase -i [base]`
  - The `-i` option stands for interactive.
  - Git will open a list of commits in your text editor. You can:
    - reword a commit to change its commit message.
    - edit a commit to make changes.
    - squash commits to combine them into a single commit.
    - reorder the commits just by changing their order in the file.
## Best Practices
- **Don't rewrite public history:** Only rebase commits that are local and haven't been shared with others.
- **Communicate with your team:** If you absolutely must rewrite history that's been shared, make sure you communicate this with your team so everyone is aware of what's happening.
---
# Advanced Git Features
## Stashing
- Stashing temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working directory so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.

### Stashing Changes:
- To stash your changes, use: `git stash`
- This command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later, and then reverts them from your working directory.
### Listing Stashes:
- To see the stashes you’ve stored, use: `git stash list`
### Applying a Stash:
- To re-apply a stashed change, and then remove it from the stash stack, use: `git stash pop`
- Alternatively, if you want to apply the stash but keep it on the stack, use: `git stash apply`
### Dropping a Stash:
- If you decide you don’t need a stash, you can remove it from the stack with: `git stash drop`

## Tagging
- Tags are used to mark specific points in a repository's history as being important - typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).

### Creating Tags:
1. **Lightweight tags**: `git tag <tagname>`
2. **Annotated tags (recommended)**: `git tag -a <tagname> -m "message about this tag"`

### Listing Tags:
- To list all the tags, use: `git tag`
### Deleting Tags:
- If you need to delete a tag, use: `git tag -d <tagname>`

## Cherry-Picking
- Cherry-picking in Git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another. 
- It’s a way to pick out the "good parts" of a branch, without having to merge in the whole branch.

### Cherry-Picking a Commit:
- First, find the commit hash you want to cherry-pick (use git log for this).
- Then, switch to the branch you want to apply the commit to.
- Use the cherry-pick command: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
- This will start the cherry-picking process and apply the changes from that commit to your branch.

 
- Stashing, tagging, and cherry-picking are advanced tools that can significantly improve your workflow once you understand how to use them effectively. 
- They offer more fine-grained control over your commits and the changes in your repository, allowing for a more polished and controlled project history. 
- As always, with great power comes great responsibility, so use these tools wisely, especially when working in a collaborative environment.
---
# Git Hooks
- Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: `commit`, `push`, and `receive`. 
- They are a powerful and flexible way to automate tasks and enforce certain workflows. 
- Git hooks can be used for a variety of tasks such as syntax checking, testing, linting, and enforcing commit message formats.

## Types of Git Hooks
- There are numerous hooks you can use, each triggered by different actions:
  1. **pre-commit:** 
     - Runs during git commit, before the commit message editor is fired up. 
     - It's used to inspect the snapshot that's about to be committed.
  2. **prepare-commit-msg:** 
    - Runs before the commit message editor is fired up but after the default message is created. 
    - It's used to edit the default commit message.
  3. **commit-msg:** 
    - Runs after the commit message is entered but before the commit is performed. 
    - It's used to validate the commit message.
  4. **post-commit:** 
    - Runs after the commit is made. 
    - It's used for notification purposes.
  5. **pre-push:** 
    - Runs during git push, before any objects have been transferred. 
    - It's used to validate what's about to be pushed.

## Setting Up Git Hooks
- Navigate to the Hooks Directory:
- Each Git repository has a hooks subdirectory in its .git directory. 
- This directory contains some example scripts that you can rename (removing the .sample extension) to activate.
- `cd .git/hooks`

## Create or Edit a Hook:
- Hooks are just scripts that can be written in any scripting language. 
- For example, you could create a pre-commit hook:
```bash
touch pre-commit
nano pre-commit  # or use any editor of your choice
```
**Make sure the script is executable:**
```bash
chmod +x pre-commit
```
**Write Your Script:**

- The script can be anything you want. 
- For example, a pre-commit hook might run tests or perform linting on your code:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Run tests
make test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests must pass before committing!"
    exit 1
fi
```
- This script runs tests with make test and cancels the commit if the tests fail.

## Best Practices
- **Version Control Your Hooks:**
  - The .git/hooks directory isn't cloned with the rest of your project, nor is it included in your repository's version control.
  - A common practice is to store your hooks in a directory within your project (e.g., git-hooks/) and then symlink those into .git/hooks.
- **Keep Hooks Simple:**
  - Hooks should be fast and simple. 
  - If a hook makes committing code cumbersome, developers will find ways to bypass them.
- **Document Hooks in Your Project:** 
  - Ensure that any hooks used by the project are well documented. 
  - This documentation should include what the hooks do, why they are necessary, and how a developer can set them up or bypass them if absolutely necessary.

# Git Internals
- To truly understand how Git works under the hood, it's essential to grasp the concepts of the internal structure of a Git repository, especially the **.git directory**, and the core objects within it: blobs, trees, commits, and refs. 
- This knowledge can be very powerful in helping you troubleshoot issues, improve performance, and understand what Git is doing behind the scenes.

## The .git Directory
- When you create a new repository with `git init`, a directory named `.git` is created. 
- This directory contains all the necessary repository metadata and objects. 
- Here's a brief overview of its structure:
  - **objects/**: Stores all the content for your database.
  - **refs/**: Holds pointers to commit objects (basically, the "branches" and "tags").
  - **HEAD**: A reference to the current branch (or current commit if you're in a detached HEAD state).
  - **config**: Repository-specific configuration settings.
  - **index**: The staging area. It keeps track of what will go into the next commit.

## Git Objects
- Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem. 
- It's a system that stores objects indexed by their content. 
- There are four main types of objects in Git: blobs, trees, commits, and refs.
### 1. Blobs
#### Blob (Binary Large Object): 
- Represents a single file in the Git database. 
- It stores the file data but doesn't contain any metadata about the file (like its name). 
- Blobs are content-addressable, which means they're named by their content.
#### Trees
- **Tree**: Represents a directory. 
- It references a bunch of blobs and other trees (subdirectories). 
- A tree object contains pointers to the blobs and trees that it contains, along with some metadata like file name, file mode, etc.
#### Commits
- **Commit:** Represents a snapshot of your working directory at a point in time. 
- A commit object points to a tree object that represents the top directory of your project. 
- It also contains metadata like the author, committer, commit message, and parent commit(s) (commits that directly precede it).
#### Refs
- **Refs (References):** 
  - Human-readable names that point to commit objects (e.g., branch and tag names). 
  - Refs are stored in the refs/ directory in the .git directory.
- **HEAD:** 
  - A special ref that points to the current branch (or sometimes a commit, if you're in a detached HEAD state). 
  - When you commit, the branch that HEAD points to is updated to point to the new commit.

## Exploring Git Internals
- You can explore these internals directly using some of Git's internal commands. 
- For instance:
  - **1. git cat-file -p <SHA>:** Shows the content of objects (blobs, trees, commits).
  - **2. git ls-tree <SHA>:** Lists the contents of a tree object.
  - **3. git log --raw:** Shows the raw format of commits.

# Best Practices
## Commit Messages
- **Concise and Descriptive:** The first line of the commit message should be a short description (50 characters is the convention), and it should explain what the commit does, not how or why.
- **Body of the Message:** If further explanation is necessary, provide a detailed description in the body of the message. Wrap the body at 72 characters and explain the what and why, not the how.
- **Use the Imperative Mood:** Write commit messages as if giving a command or instruction (e.g., "Fix bug" or "Update file" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Updated file").
- **Reference Issues:** If the commit is related to an issue or task, include the reference number in the commit message.

## Branching and Merging
- **Branch for Each Feature:** Create a new branch for each feature or significant piece of work. This keeps the main branch clean and production-ready.
- **Short-Lived Feature Branches:** Try to keep feature branches short-lived. Merge them back into the main branch as soon as the feature is complete and tested.
- **Merge Strategies:** Be consistent with your merge strategy (e.g., merge commit, squash merge, or rebase and merge). Squash merging is beneficial for keeping a clean history, whereas a merge commit preserves the history of a feature branch.

## Maintaining a Clean History
- **Rebase for Linear History:** Use git rebase instead of git merge to integrate changes from the main branch into your feature branch. This avoids unnecessary merge commits and keeps the history linear and clean.
- **Squash Commits:** Squash minor commits together into a single, cohesive commit that makes it easier to understand the history.
- **Avoid Rewriting Public History:** Don't rewrite the history of public branches like main or develop. If you need to correct something, prefer adding a new commit.

## General Best Practices
- **Pull Regularly:** Regularly pull changes from the main branch into your feature branch to stay up to date and avoid large merge conflicts.
- **Use .gitignore:** Use a .gitignore file to avoid committing unnecessary files (e.g., log files, temporary files, or locally installed modules).
- **Code Review:** Utilize pull requests for code review. They provide a way to contribute to a project without needing to change the main codebase directly.
- **Backup:** Regularly push your branches to the remote repository to back them up.
- **Documentation:** Document your repository structure, branching strategy, commit message conventions, and any other important information in a README.md or a CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## I am confused between git fetch, git rebase, git pull, git update and git merge.
In summary:
- Use **git fetch** to download new data from a remote repository.
- Use **git pull** to update your current branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
- Use **git rebase** to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit, often used to clean up commit history.
- Use **git update-index** for lower-level operations directly on the index or staging area (if that's what you meant by git update).

### git fetch
- **What it does:** git fetch downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.
- **Impact on your local work:** git fetch alone **does not** change your local working state. That means your current work is untouched. Fetching updates your remote tracking branches (like origin/main).
- **Typical use-case:** You want to see what others have committed to the repo, but you're not ready to integrate those changes into your local work just yet.

### git pull
- **What it does:** git pull is essentially a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. When you use git pull, Git will automatically fetch the remote changes and then merge them into your current branch.
- **Impact on your local work:** git pull **will** change your local working state. It will update your current branch to include the latest commits from the remote repository.
- **Typical use-case:** You're ready to bring your local branch up-to-date with the remote repository's latest commits.

### git rebase
- **What it does:** git rebase is a way to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It's often used to clean up a messy history by squashing multiple commits into one or by changing the order of commits.
- **Impact on your local work:** git rebase **will** change your local working state. It rewrites the commit history by creating new commits for each commit in the original branch.
- **Typical use-case:** You've been working on a feature branch and want to integrate the latest changes from the main branch into your feature branch, but you want to do it in a way that keeps the history clean and linear.

### git update (Assuming you mean git update-index)
- **What it does:** git update-index is a lower-level command that directly manipulates the index or staging area. It can mark files as modified, add files, and do other index-related operations.
- **Impact on your local work:** It directly affects the index or staging area. It doesn't change any files in your working directory.
- **Typical use-case:** It's a more advanced command that's generally used in scripts or more complex Git workflows. It's not commonly used in everyday Git operations.
