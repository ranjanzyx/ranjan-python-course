## Course Overview:
- This Python programming course is designed for beginners.
- The duration of the course is **30 days**, with daily **1-hour** sessions.
- The curriculum is divided into six weeks, each exploring a different aspects of Python programming.
    - **Week 1:** Introduction and Basics
    - **Week 2:** Data Structures and Functions
    - **Week 3:** Intermediate Concepts and Debugging
    - **Week 4:** Object-Oriented Programming
    - **Week 5:** Advanced Topics and Introduction to Testing
    - **Week 6:** Introduction to Django & Development of Mini Project
- We will be using **Python 3.12.1**, the latest version of Python. 
- We will be using **PyCharm** as our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and testing our Python code. 
    
## Daily Session Breakdown:
1. **Initial 10 Minutes** - Discussion on the previous day assignments
2. **Main 40 Minutes** - Core Learning for the day
3. **Final 10 Minutes** - QnA and next day assignments discussion


## Collaboration Tools:
1. **Course Material Distribution via GitHub:**
    - GitHub will be our primary platform for sharing course materials. 
    - After each session, I will upload the day's materials to GitHub.
    - You can access these materials any time [GitHub - Python Course](https://github.com/ranjanzyx/ranjan-python-course).
2. **Utilizing Slack for Peer-to-Peer Interaction:**
    - Our designated Slack group will act as a self-help community. 
    - We can post queries, engage in discussions, and assist each other with challenges. 
3. **Google Colab for Practical Data Science Exploration:**
    - As we progress to the data science modules of our course, we will start using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). 
    - This platform allows for hands-on experimentation in a cloud-based environment. 
    - This is ideal for practicing data science concepts without the need for complex setup or high-end hardware.
